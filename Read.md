Django Framework

ðŸ’¡ Tools and Technologies Used : 
1. Python 
2. Django
3. OpenSSL

Issue
Understanding Django Framework :
1. Establishing a User Login Authentication Page.
2. Implementing HTTPS for hosting.

   
ðŸ’­ Platforms
The Environments used to test the Project: 
1. Windows 10
2. Kali Linux

   
ðŸ›« Implementation

Installing Python: 
a. Download and install python3.11 from
      https://www.python.org/
b. Add Python to the path in Environment Variables
c. Use the following code to create virtual environment
      python3.11 -m venv myenv
d. Activate the scripts ; go to the scripts folder
           ./activate
e.Install the requirements.txt
              pip install -r requirements.txt

The virtual environment is already included into the git file, hence we can ignore this.


Configuring Django:

a.  Create a django Project

      django-admin startproject *AnyName
      
b. Use this to open and migrate the server

         python manage.py migrate
  Then run the server
  
  
        python manage.py runserver
        
c. Start the django app

      django-admin startapp testing
      
d. Now we need to register this file in settings.py

         '*appname',
         
e. Create and connect url.py and view.py
     We are trying to connect the app to django project. Open urls.py in the project and add 
         
          from django.urls import path,include
           path('',include('testing.urls'))
     
    Now we will be able to create urls in the app itself

f. Update views to add the required pages.

g.Create a subfolder with the app Name and create a Templates folder here.

        Inside the folder , create
        'index.html'
        'register.html'
        'my-login.html'
        'dashboard.html'
h. Implement access restrictions . 
       
        After setting up the app,make sure to restrict access to the dashboard to only logged-in users

i. Use Django forms to perform the register and login authentication functions.

j. I have created a Super User using 
 
          python manage.py createsuperuser
 
   Now we run the migrate command , before starting the server
            
            python manage.py makemigrations
           python manage.py migrate


OpenSSl

a.Install OpenSSl to create,sign certificate and keys.

b.We are hosting a development server from our localhost environment.

c. So, if we want to host using https , we can implement it using a self-signed certificate or
   create a local CA to sign the certificate.

d.In this project, I created a local Certificate Authority (CA) and used
  it to sign certificates for mylocal domain.
  1. To create a Local CA :

          openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out rootCA.key
          openssl req -x509 -new -key rootCA.key -out rootCA.crt
  2. Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR):

   For each domain we want a certificate , we need to create a CSR

          openssl req -new -key localhost.key -out localhost.csr -subj "/CN=localhost"

   3. Sign the CSR with the Local CA:

     Now use the local CA we created to sign the CSR and generate a certificate

         openssl x509 -req -in localhost.csr -CA rootCA.crt -CAkey rootCA.key -CAcreateserial -out localhost.crt -days 365
e.But while implementing the Django app , the browser still shows warning as the local CA is unrecognized.
  We can import the rootCA.crt to the browser's managed certificates place it in Trusted Root Certification A
  The browser still gives warning but exempts.So now , we understood how to implement using https.

Functionality:

1. Users can register in the webpage , and their details would be stored

2. Username , Email ID would be checked in the server , if there are any matching instances if so ,
   they would be asked to change the Username or the Email accordingly.

3. As do not store Raw Passwords, Django encrypts them using SHA256 , then asks to enter the password again ,
   to encrypt and verify the both hash outputs.

4. In the login page , if the Users have registered they can log-in using their credentials. So , after they login they will be redirected to the Dashboard. They 
   can also log-out from the dashboard,after they will be redirected to the home page.
   
6. The Super User can have change/access their admin privileges in the admin page
   which is the website path +'/admin'.


Working:

Windows
 
1. Navigate to the `myenv/scripts` directory using the `cd` command, then execute:

         ./activate

2. Next, proceed to the Test Folder and run the following Command:
   

         python manage.py runsslserver --cert localhost.crt --key localhost.key
 
Bash 

1. Open the Testing Folder, navigate to the Test Folder and run the following Command:
   

       python manage.py runsslserver --cert localhost.crt --key localhost.ke
